# MeasurementInvarianceExplorer 
A new Shiny tool a vailable at https://rudnev.shinyapps.io/measurement_invariance_explorer/

This repository doesn't contain any code yet, as the project is in its early stage.
This project is intended to be an open-source. As far as I am ready to publish code you will find it here. 
Until then, I appreciate any bug reports and feature suggestions in the Issues section.
